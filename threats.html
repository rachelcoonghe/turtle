			<h2>Threats to Sea turtles</h2>
			<div class="description">
				<p>Sea turtles face numerous threats that endanger their survival. These include habitat loss due to coastal development, pollution, and destruction of nesting sites. Climate change affects their reproductive cycles and nesting habitats. Pollution, especially plastic debris, can be ingested by turtles, causing harm or even death. Entanglement in fishing gear, illegal wildlife trade, and predation also pose significant risks. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect sea turtles from these threats and ensure their long-term survival.

                <h1>Why are sea turtles endangered?</h1>
                <h2>5 Major Threats</h2>

                  <h2>Fisheries bycatch</h2>
                  <p class="text">It’s estimated that the fishing industry contributes to the death of thousands to tens of thousands of sea turtles each year. Turtles that become trapped in longlines, gill nets and trawls are thrown away as bycatch. And those that manage to avoid fishing nets are impacted by the disruption to their food supply and habitat.</p>

                  <h2>Pollution pathogens</h2>
                  <p class="text">Marine pollution can harm sea turtles in many ways. Plastic pollution, discarded fishing gear, petroleum by-products, and other debris injure sea turtles through ingestion and entanglement. Ocean pollution can also weaken the turtles’ immune systems, and disrupt nesting behavior and hatchling orientation.</p>

                  <p class="text">We are just now learning the extent to which climate change can affect sea turtles. Climate change can impact the natural sex ratios of hatchlings, increase the likelihood of disease outbreaks, and can escalate the frequency of extreme weather events, which destroy nesting beaches and coral reefs.</p>

                  <p class="text">Throughout the world, turtles are killed and traded on the global market as exotic food, oil, leather, and jewelry. Over the past 100 years, millions of hawkbill turtles alone have been killed just for the price of their shells. And even though today the global trade of luxury and craft items has reduced thanks to conservation efforts, it still remains an ongoing threat to turtles in parts of Africa, Asia and the Americas.</p>
